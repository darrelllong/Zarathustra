## Current Run: v16

**Status**: Running on vinge (GB10 CUDA, AMP fp16, no compile)
- PID: 150086
- Log: `vinge:~/train_v16.log`
- Checkpoints: `vinge:~/checkpoints/tencent_v16/`
- Started: 2026-03-30

**What changed vs v15:**
1. `--diversity-loss-weight 0.5` (was 0): Restores MSGAN recall-boosting loss from v14g.
   v14g recall=0.372 had it; v15 recall=0.294 didn't. Direct fix for recall gap.
2. `--cross-cov-loss-weight 2.0` (was 0.5): Reduces supervisor dominance from 10:1 to 2.5:1.
3. `--n-critic 2` (was 3): Between v14c (too conservative) and v15 (underdamped oscillation).
4. `--lr-d 2.5e-5` (was 5e-5): Lower critic LR to further damp oscillation.
5. `--epochs 150`: Short ablation — no point running 600ep if cycling kills improvement by ep110.

## Version Notes

### v14 (killed, 2026-03-28)
WGAN-SN without spectral norm on the critic LSTM: only the FC output layer was Lipschitz-constrained.
LSTM weights drifted unconstrained — W grew from 2.7 to 31 by epoch 100, recall hit 0.
Best was epoch 30 (first eval) before the drift began.

### v14c–v14e (hot-starts from v14/epoch_0030.pt, 2026-03-28–29)
All failed because loading a generator trained against an unconstrained critic into a freshly
SN-normalised critic creates a permanent power asymmetry. The SN u/v buffers are initialised
randomly; the critic wins decisively until they converge, by which point G is stuck.
**Lesson**: never hot-start from a checkpoint whose critic had different Lipschitz constraints.

### v14f (hot-start from v14c/epoch_0030.pt, killed ep190, 2026-03-29)
First test with diversity_loss_weight=0.5. Stable but plateaued. Full eval revealed that
training-log β-recall (0.269) and eval.py β-recall (0.021) diverge by ~13×:
training uses EMA weights + 1000 samples, eval uses live checkpoint + 2000 samples.
**Lesson**: training-log recall numbers are ~3–4× optimistic; trust full eval.py only.

### v14g (fresh from scratch, 2026-03-29–30)

First clean run with SN-LSTM from epoch 0. Key changes vs v14f:
- Fresh pretraining: AE 50ep + supervisor 50ep (supervisor_steps=2) + G warmup 50ep
- diversity_loss_weight=0.5: MSGAN recall fix (present in v14f, kept)
- cross_cov_loss_weight=0.5: full d×d lag-1 cross-feature covariance (new; targets DMD-GEN)
- lr_g=1e-4, lr_d=5e-5 (original v13 LRs; hot-starts used 5e-5/2.5e-5)

**Full eval (ep90)**: MMD²=0.018, α-precision=0.910, β-recall=0.372, DMD-GEN=0.700, Context-FID=0.03

**Root causes identified (fixed in v15):**
1. `reuse_rate=0.000`: delta-encoding makes obj_id reuse a zero-measure event in continuous space.
   Fix: split obj_id into `obj_id_reuse` (±1 binary) + `obj_id_stride` (signed-log delta).
2. DMD-GEN stuck at 0.700: supervisor_loss_weight (5.0) overpowers cross_cov_loss_weight (0.5) by 10×.
   Fix: raise cross_cov_loss_weight to 2.0 (v16).
3. obj_size non-quantized: generated sizes are continuous; real traces are multiples of 4096 bytes.
   Fix: snap to 4096-byte multiples before log-transform (v15).

### v15 (vinge/GB10, killed ep143, 2026-03-30)

First CUDA run. Applied all v14g root-cause fixes (obj_id split, obj_size quantization).
AMP fp16 enabled. torch.compile attempted but Triton broken on GB10 (libcuda.so link issue).

**Best (ep100)**: MMD²=0.029, β-recall=0.294, combined=0.170

**What went wrong:**
1. **Missing diversity_loss** (was in v14g, dropped from v15): direct cause of recall gap.
2. **GAN cycling (n_critic=3 too aggressive)**: ep100 best → ep110 MMD²=0.111 spike → never recovered.
3. **cross_cov still 10:1 drowned**: DMD-GEN stayed at ~0.700.

**Bugs found and fixed during v15 (all committed):**
- `torch.quantile` fp16 crash: cast to `.float()` before quantile (e3ad770)
- `evaluate_metrics()` left G/R in `.eval()`: `try/finally` restore in mmd.py (01a797f)
- E/R/S left in `.eval()` from pretrain phases: explicit `.train()` at GAN loop start (ba356d5)
- Supervisor gradient leak in G step: `torch.no_grad()` around `S(H_fake)` (f5c63b7)
- EMA seeded from random init: seed from post-warmup G after Phase 2.5 (f5c63b7)
- GradScaler called n_critic+2 times per batch instead of once: now called once per optimizer step (638ee24)
- rsync temp files in trace dir: `not p.name.startswith(".")` filter in `_collect_files` (0ca6f49)

## Key Metrics and Targets

| Metric | v13 | v14g | v15 | Target | Description |
|--------|-----|------|-----|--------|-------------|
| MMD² | 0.00818 | 0.018 | 0.029 | < 0.005 | Kernel distribution distance |
| β-recall | 0.455 | 0.372 | 0.294 | > 0.7 | Coverage: fraction of real modes covered |
| α-precision | 0.812 | 0.910 | — | > 0.85 | Fidelity: fraction of generated that is realistic |
| DMD-GEN | 0.771 | 0.700 | ~0.700 | < 0.3 | Temporal dynamics divergence (0 = perfect) |
| reuse-rate | 0.124 | 0.000 | TBD | > 0.1 | Fraction of obj_id repeats (sequential access) |

Note: v14g had better MMD² than v13 despite lower β-recall. v14g is the best MMD²–recall trade-off
we have achieved. All new runs must beat v14g's combined score (0.018 MMD² + 0.2×(1-0.372) = 0.144).

## What We Have Learned

### Architecture
- **GRU for AE/supervisor, LSTM for G+C**: GRU is simpler + faster for compression/prediction;
  LSTM cell state captures long-range context needed for G and burst detection in C.
- **Split noise (z_global + z_local)**: z_global maps to LSTM h0/c0 (workload identity);
  z_local feeds per-step input (event noise). Without this, every window is independent.
- **Latent AE (TimeGAN/SeriesGAN)**: Direct feature-space GAN is unstable in a 6-feature
  correlated space spanning 10 decades. AE reduces to smooth 24-dim latent space.
- **Minibatch std in critic (StyleGAN2)**: Collapsed G produces identical rows; std→0.
  This channel gives the critic a diversity signal before collapse propagates.
- **sn_lstm=True**: SN on LSTM weight matrices essential (not just FC output).
  FC-only SN allows LSTM to drift; W grows unboundedly and training collapses (v14).

### Training stability
- **GAN cycling / underdamped oscillation**: When critic pressure is too high (n_critic=3,
  high lr_d), G overshoots → critic wins decisively → G overshoots back. Seen in v13 (171
  wasted epochs) and v15. Damp with: lower n_critic, lower lr_d, cosine LR decay.
- **Hot-start asymmetry**: Never hot-start from a checkpoint with different Lipschitz constraints.
  Fresh SN u/v buffers + generator tuned for old critic → critic overpowers immediately.
- **Phase train/eval mode**: Each pretrain phase explicitly sets eval on modules it doesn't train.
  Must restore `.train()` on ALL modules at GAN loop start, or cuDNN RNN backward crashes.
- **GradScaler with n_critic > 1**: `scaler.unscale_(optimizer)` can only be called once
  per optimizer between `scaler.update()` calls. With n_critic > 1 and grad clipping,
  call `scaler.update()` after each `scaler.step(opt_C)` within the critic loop.
- **EMA**: Seed ema_G_state from post-warmup G weights (not random init). Random seed means
  first GAN evals use near-random EMA, skewing best.pt selection.

### Losses
- **L_FM (feature matching)**: Smoother gradient signal than Wasserstein alone; reduces collapse.
- **L_div (diversity, MSGAN)**: Directly combats β-recall mode collapse. Required in v14g
  (recall=0.372) vs v15 without it (recall=0.294). Weight 0.5 works; try 0.5–1.0.
- **L_cov (cross-covariance)**: Targets DMD-GEN directly. Needs weight ≥ 2.0 to overcome
  supervisor dominance at weight 5.0 (otherwise 10:1 ratio drowns cross_cov signal).
- **L_loc**: Stride-repetition rate — replaced by obj_id_reuse binary feature in v15+.
  Still active as auxiliary loss but its role is partly absorbed by the locality split.
- **L_ACF, L_FFT**: Effective for temporal structure; keep at current weights.
- **L_V, L_Q**: Cheap distributional anchors; always-on.

### Data representation
- **obj_id delta → locality split (v15)**: Raw delta-encoding makes reuse a zero-measure event.
  `obj_id_reuse` (±1 binary) + `obj_id_stride` (signed-log delta) gives G a learnable
  binary classification target for sequential access patterns.
- **obj_size quantization (v15)**: Snap to 4096-byte multiples before log-transform.
  Real block traces have discrete sizes; continuous representation wastes capacity.
- **Training-log recall is ~3–4× optimistic vs full eval** (EMA weights + 1000 samples
  vs live checkpoint + 2000 samples). Never abort based on training-log recall alone.

### Infrastructure notes
- **torch.compile**: Broken on vinge's GB10 (Triton can't find libcuda.so.1). Use `--no-compile`.
- **AMP fp16**: Works correctly. `torch.quantile` requires `.float()` cast before call.
- **pretrain_complete.pt**: State dict keys have no `_orig_mod.` prefix (saved without compile).
  Load into non-compiled models only (`--no-compile`). Avoids 35-min pretrain on restart.
- **SSH to vinge**: `ssh vinge.local` (RSA key, no passphrase). `-A` flag for git pull on GitHub.
