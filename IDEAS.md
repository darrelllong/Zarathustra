## Priority: Bold Architectural Changes

Parameter tuning is unlikely to produce the breakthrough needed. The ideas below are ordered by expected impact. The Bayesian approaches at the top represent fundamental structural changes to how the model represents and covers the workload distribution — not incremental loss tweaks.

---

### 1. Gaussian Mixture Prior on latent z (GMM-GAN)

**Why this is the breakthrough candidate:** The generator currently samples `z ~ N(0, I)` — a single unimodal prior. But workloads come from clearly distinct regimes (burst, sequential, random-read, write-heavy). The diversity loss tries to fight this after the fact. A GMM prior makes multi-modal coverage *structural*.

The hypothesis for why v40 recall is plateauing at ~0.40 while v31 reached 0.596: v31's noisy window-level z_global accidentally created a soft mixture prior over workload types. Replacing it with clean char-file conditioning collapsed that mixture structure. A GMM prior restores it — but deliberately and properly.

**Implementation:**
- K=8–16 mixture components, each `N(μ_k, σ_k²I)` in latent space
- Char-file conditioning (write_ratio, burstiness_cv, reuse_ratio, etc.) selects the component via a learned soft assignment `π_k(cond)`
- Sample `z ~ N(μ_{k*}, σ_{k*}²I)` where `k* ~ Categorical(π(cond))`
- Add a commitment loss to keep each component well-separated
- The critic sees no change; only G's prior changes

**Expected impact:** Directly breaks the recall ceiling by giving G explicit "mode addresses." Each workload type lives in its own region of latent space rather than competing for the same unimodal prior.

### 2. Bayesian GAN — posterior over discriminators (BayesGAN)

**Why this is bold:** Replace the single discriminator point estimate with a *posterior distribution over discriminators*, sampled via SGLD. The generator sees a mixture of discriminators; no single boundary can force collapse to one mode. Mathematically, the Nash equilibrium of BayesGAN corresponds to the generator matching the full data distribution, not a single mode.

**Implementation:**
- Replace Adam optimizer on D with SGLD: `θ_D ← θ_D - η∇L + N(0, 2η)`
- Maintain M=10 discriminator particles; update all each step
- Generator loss is the average across particles
- This adds ~10× D memory but D is small (LSTM + FC)

**Expected impact:** The single strongest anti-mode-collapse technique known. Recall improvements of 20–40% over point-estimate GANs reported on multimodal benchmarks.

### 3. Variational conditioning — uncertainty over workload type

**Why this matters:** The char-file gives a *point estimate* of file characteristics. But two files with the same write_ratio can have very different temporal dynamics. A Bayesian approach: replace the fixed conditioning vector with a learned distribution.

**Implementation:**
- Add a small MLP `(μ_cond, log σ_cond) = f(char_stats)`
- Sample `cond ~ N(μ_cond, σ_cond)` via reparameterization at training time
- Add KL divergence penalty: `KL(q(cond|stats) || p(cond))`
- Use `μ_cond` (no sampling) at eval time

**Why it may close the EMA→full eval gap:** The gap arises because training-time conditioning is slightly different from eval-time. Explicit uncertainty modeling makes the generator robust to conditioning noise — same effect CFG dropout achieves, but principled.

This is cheap (~20 lines) and can stack on top of v40 without architectural surgery.

### 4. GP prior on latent trajectories (for DMD-GEN)

**Why this targets the DMD-GEN plateau:** DMD-GEN is stuck at ~0.72 because the LSTM generates temporally incoherent sequences — it has no structural prior that consecutive latent states should be smooth or autocorrelated. A Gaussian Process prior on `{z_1, ..., z_T}` imposes exactly this.

**Implementation:**
- Replace `z_t ~ N(0,I)` i.i.d. with a GP sample: `z_{1:T} ~ GP(0, K)` where K is a Matérn or RBF kernel
- Approximate with a low-rank inducing point method for efficiency
- The kernel lengthscale is a learnable parameter — lets the model discover the right temporal correlation scale

**Expected impact:** Directly targets DMD-GEN. GP time-series priors have been shown to capture autocorrelation structure that LSTMs alone cannot.

### 5. Regime-first, event-second generation (two-stage)

**Why this is bold:** Rather than asking one flat LSTM to jointly model regime identity, burst envelope, IAT, size, and locality, split into two stages:

- **Stage 1 (regime sampler):** Given char-file conditioning, sample a discrete regime code + continuous regime parameters (burst rate, access pattern, size distribution mode). This is a small VAE or normalizing flow.
- **Stage 2 (event generator):** Condition the LSTM on the regime code/parameters and generate per-event requests.

**Why it fits Zarathustra:** Current errors are regime-level — the model generates plausible individual events but the wrong *kind* of workload. A two-stage model can't confuse regimes because Stage 1 commits to one before Stage 2 starts.

### 6. Path-space critic (PCF-GAN / COT-GAN)

**Why this is bold:** Every auxiliary loss we've added (ACF, cross-cov, locality, FFT) is a handcrafted proxy for "does this sequence have the right dynamics?" A path-space critic replaces all of them with a *single learned functional* that directly compares distributions over sequences using the path characteristic function or causal optimal transport.

- No more loss weight tuning
- Discriminates on the full trajectory, not marginal statistics
- Directly targets DMD-GEN and AutoCorr without ad hoc terms

### 7. Mixed-type output heads (tabular GAN style)

Model the known type structure of I/O fields explicitly rather than pushing everything through one regression head.

- Separate heads: opcode → softmax, reuse flag → sigmoid, IAT/size → continuous regression, stride → signed log-normal
- Training-time conditional sampling to emphasize underrepresented field combinations
- Why it fits: opcode and reuse are not the same kind of target as IAT. Forcing one head to handle both corrupts gradients.

### 8. Multi-resolution / multi-branch critics

Use multiple discriminator views at different temporal scales — raw events, pooled windows, locality-only channel, stitched multi-window sequences.

Audio GANs (HiFi-GAN) improved dramatically once the discriminator could see both fine texture and larger periodic structure. Traces have the same multi-scale problem.

### 9. Self-diagnosing upweighting of underrepresented modes

Identify real windows the model currently under-covers (by reuse rate, stride pattern, burstiness) and upweight them in critic training and feature matching. Principled alternative to blindly increasing diversity loss everywhere.

### 10. Conditional generator + projection discriminator

Condition both generator and critic on char-file workload descriptors. The critic scores "is this realistic *for this workload type*?" rather than "is this realistic in aggregate?"

Blocked until G has trained on char-file conditioning for ~100+ epochs (v38 showed proj_critic + fresh G = W explosion). Safe to add in v41 after v40 trains.

### 11. Deeper LSTM (2–3 layers)

**Why this matters now:** R characterization found 23 temporal changepoints for tencent and
21 for alibaba. The Hurst exponent is 0.79 (tencent) and 0.98 (alibaba), indicating strong
long-range temporal dependence. A single LSTM layer has limited capacity for hierarchical
temporal representations — the first layer must simultaneously track per-step dynamics AND
multi-scale regime structure.

**Implementation:**
- Change LSTM in both Generator and Critic from `num_layers=1` to `num_layers=2` (or 3)
- Add residual connections between layers to prevent gradient degradation
- Optionally: different hidden sizes per layer (e.g., 256→128 pyramid)
- Minimal code change — PyTorch LSTM supports `num_layers` natively

**Expected impact:** Better capture of multi-scale temporal structure (burst envelopes,
regime transitions, long-range stride autocorrelation). R found that the data has structure
at 96-file, 127-file, and 164-file scales (Tencent changepoint spacing) — a single LSTM
layer may lack the representational depth to model these overlapping timescales simultaneously.

**Risk:** Deeper models are harder to train and more prone to gradient issues. May need
lower learning rate or gradient clipping adjustments. Pretrain checkpoints are incompatible
(architecture change).

---

### 12. Expanded conditioning (cond_dim 10 → 13)

**Why:** R analysis identified three features with significant signal that we don't use:
- `object_unique` (Tencent median=1788, Alibaba=2182) — object diversity directly controls
  reuse/seek balance
- `signed_stride_lag1_autocorr` (Tencent=-0.17, Alibaba=-0.41) — stride memory is a
  different signal from IAT autocorr
- `obj_size_std` — distribution spread, not just center (q50)

Also: `backward_seek_ratio` is redundant (= 1 - forward - reuse) and `opcode_switch_ratio`
is always 0 after auto-drop. Net: drop 2, add 3 → cond_dim 11 (or 13 if keeping both).

See R-REBUTTAL.md for details.

---

### 13. Block sampling for alibaba (Hurst=0.98)

**Why:** Alibaba's Hurst exponent is 0.98 (near-persistent). Consecutive files' PC1 scores
are almost perfectly correlated — files are NOT exchangeable. Our random `files-per-epoch=12`
sampling destroys this temporal structure. Block sampling (contiguous file windows) would
give the generator batches with realistic within-batch diversity.

**Implementation:** Add `--block-sample` flag to sample contiguous file ranges instead of
random files per epoch. Easy change in the dataloader.

## Deprioritized (incremental, not bold)

- **PacGAN packed critic** — tried in v39, didn't break recall ceiling
- **Full relativistic GAN objective** — tried in v39 (RpGAN), caused C_loss→0 immediately, worse than WGAN-SN
- **Structured generator factorization** — valid but overlaps with regime-first (#5); do that first
- **BayesGAN M=2 + regime sampler** — tried in v56, G_loss stayed positive, recall stuck 0.27-0.33. BayesGAN redundant when regime sampler already provides mode coverage.
- **Projection discriminator** — tried in v55, W-distance exploded to 38.6 in 5 epochs. Critic too powerful with workload conditioning.

---

## Tried and validated

- **#1 GMM prior (--gmm-components)** — implemented, part of ATB recipe
- **#3 Variational conditioning (--var-cond)** — implemented, part of alibaba recipe
- **#5 Regime sampler (--n-regimes 8)** — validated: v54 reached combined=0.108★ (0.019 from ATB)
- **#8 Multi-scale critic (--multi-scale-critic)** — implemented

## Execution order (updated 2026-04-05)

1. ~~v40–v54: char-file, GMM, var_cond, regime sampler~~ (DONE)
2. **v57 (running):** v54 remastered with clip fix — test if surviving past ep100 beats ATB
3. **Next:** K=2 regime sampler — silhouette analysis shows K=2 is optimal (0.94 vs 0.50 at K=4+). Our K=8 may be over-partitioning. Test K=2 and K=3.
4. **Then:** Deeper LSTM (#11) — 2-layer generator+critic, new pretrain required
5. **Then:** Expanded conditioning (#12) — add object_unique, stride_autocorr, obj_size_std; drop 5 near-constant dims
6. **Then:** Block sampling for alibaba (#13)
7. **Then:** Self-diagnosing upweighting (#9)
8. **Then:** Path-space critic (#6) — biggest swing, replaces all auxiliary losses
